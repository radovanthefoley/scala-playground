  /** Returns a list of all anagram sentences of the given sentence.
    *
    * An anagram of a sentence is formed by taking the occurrences of all the characters of
    * all the words in the sentence, and producing all possible combinations of words with those characters,
    * such that the words have to be from the dictionary.
    *
    * The number of words in the sentence and its anagrams does not have to correspond.
    * For example, the sentence `List("I", "love", "you")` is an anagram of the sentence `List("You", "olive")`.
    *
    * Also, two sentences with the same words but in a different order are considered two different anagrams.
    * For example, sentences `List("You", "olive")` and `List("olive", "you")` are different anagrams of
    * `List("I", "love", "you")`.
    *
    * Here is a full example of a sentence `List("Yes", "man")` and its anagrams for our dictionary:
    *
    * List(
    * List(en, as, my),
    * List(en, my, as),
    * List(man, yes),
    * List(men, say),
    * List(as, en, my),
    * List(as, my, en),
    * List(sane, my),
    * List(Sean, my),
    * List(my, en, as),
    * List(my, as, en),
    * List(my, sane),
    * List(my, Sean),
    * List(say, men),
    * List(yes, man)
    * )
    *
    * The different sentences do not have to be output in the order shown above - any order is fine as long as
    * all the anagrams are there. Every returned word has to exist in the dictionary.
    *
    * Note: in case that the words of the sentence are in the dictionary, then the sentence is the anagram of itself,
    * so it has to be returned in this list.
    *
    * Note: There is only one anagram of an empty sentence.
